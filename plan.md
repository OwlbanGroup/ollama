### Plan to Address "undefined: runtime" Issue

1. **`gpu/amd_windows.go`**
   - Review the usage of the `runtime` package and ensure that any necessary runtime information is being utilized effectively. If there are any missing implementations or checks, add them to enhance functionality.

2. **`envconfig/config.go`**
   - Verify that the configurations set based on the runtime environment are functioning correctly. If any issues are identified, make adjustments to ensure proper handling of environment variables.

3. **`gpu/gpu_test.go`**
   - Ensure that the tests are comprehensive and cover all scenarios related to runtime. If any tests are failing due to runtime issues, modify them accordingly to ensure they pass.

4. **`gpu/assets.go`**
   - Review the logic for updating the PATH environment variable based on the OS. Ensure that it is functioning as intended and make any necessary adjustments.

5. **`gpu/gpu_info.go`**
   - Confirm that the functions for retrieving GPU and CPU information are working correctly. If there are any issues related to runtime, address them to ensure accurate information retrieval.

### Follow-up Steps:
- After making the necessary changes, run the tests to verify that everything is functioning correctly.
- Document any changes made for future reference.
